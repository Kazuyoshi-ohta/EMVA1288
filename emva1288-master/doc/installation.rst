Installation
============

For inexperienced windows users it is recommended to use a prepackaged
python distribution that contains the required packages. One excellent
option for Windows users is `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/>`__

Once the python environment is installed just run ::

  >> pip install emva1288

If you want to contribute to this project, clone it and install it::

  >> git clone https://github.com/EMVA1288/emva1288.git (or from a fork)
  >> python setup.py develop

If you make code modifications, you can run the unittests to make sure
nothing important is broken::

  >> python tests.py

This will run the test suite and print the code coverage in the console.
